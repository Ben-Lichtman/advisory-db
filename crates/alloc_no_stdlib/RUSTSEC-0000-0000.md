# alloc_no_stdlib gives out references to uninitialized data to library users

The following code demonstrates this library giving out a slice of uninitialized memory as its allocation 

```rust
let mut malloc_global_buffer =
	unsafe { define_allocator_memory_pool!(4096, u8, [0; 200 * 1024 * 1024], malloc) };
let mut ags =
	MallocAllocatedFreelist4096::<u8>::new_allocator(&mut malloc_global_buffer.data, bzero);
let mut uninit = ags.alloc_cell(4);
let uninit_slice = uninit.as_mut();
let boom = uninit_slice[0]; // reading uninitized data from the allocation
```

This is dangerous because it would allow information disclosure by reading data that was previously allocated where the memory pool currently is, as well as causing UB and a risk of miscompilation.
